# External Learning Landing

Treat the external system as a pattern source, not local authority.

## Workflow

1. Read the current external primary source and the target repo's owner surfaces.
2. Extract reusable behavior, data shape, failure handling, evaluation, or workflow patterns without importing foreign branding or runtime assumptions.
3. Classify each candidate as `adopt`, `adapt`, `watch_only`, `reject`, or `no_code_needed`.
4. For `adopt` or `adapt`, map the candidate to one existing local owner surface, intended behavior change, and claim-appropriate acceptance evidence.
5. Prefer current repo/platform/dependency capabilities. Do not create a second source of truth, package manager, runtime, queue, dashboard, or authority plane when a smaller local landing suffices.
6. Implement only when the user authorized implementation; otherwise produce an approval-ready brief.
7. Verify the final local surface and loaded/readback copy when the result is generated, installed, cached, or projected.

## Candidate Record

For each pattern, report:

- external source and inspected version/date;
- classification and reason;
- local owner surface;
- proposed behavior or artifact;
- verification evidence;
- risk, authority boundary, and stop condition.

`no_code_needed` requires fresh local evidence that the current owner already covers the pattern. `watch_only` and `reject` are valid outcomes.

External runtime or authority integration requires both an explicit user request and a supported local integration slot. Domain truth, quality verdicts, release readiness, owner receipts, and runtime authority remain with their existing owners.

For "fully absorb" requests, reuse the active profile's normal completion audit; do not create a second Learning Landing audit or duplicate worktree/subagent policy here.
